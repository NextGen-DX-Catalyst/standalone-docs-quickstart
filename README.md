# Standalone Docs Quickstart

This is the documentation for Quickstart, built with MkDocs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Python 3.5 or later)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
- MkDocs: Install it using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install mkdocs
  ```

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository directory]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running Locally

To run the MkDocs server locally and view the documentation in your browser:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This command starts a local server. You can view your documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser.

### Editing Documentation

Edit the documentation files located in the `docs` directory. MkDocs uses Markdown files for the documentation. After saving your changes, MkDocs will automatically rebuild the pages, and you can see the updates in your browser.

### Building the Documentation

To build a static site from the documentation:

```bash
mkdocs build
```

This command creates a `site` directory with your documentation formatted as static HTML pages.

## Deployment

For deploying the built static site, refer to the [MkDocs deployment guide](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/).
